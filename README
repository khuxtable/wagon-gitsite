This is Kathryn Huxtable's gitsite wagon.

Code from Anthony Whitford <anthony@whitford.com> adds support for
multi-module projects.

Stephen Connolly <stephen.alan.connolly@gmail.com> made some changes to
the documentation.

Hopefully, the changes in this fork will be integrated into the original
project.
